# The Purpose of the IIBA Global Business Analysis Core Standard

The IIBA Global Business Analysis Core Standard represents the core and most fundamental practices of business analysis as described in A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK® Guide) version 3.

The IIBA Global Business Analysis Core Standard has been created by IIBA for the global business community. It is intended to help all organizations and practitioners of business analysis provide better business outcomes.

The IIBA Global Business Analysis Core Standard presents an abridged version of the foundational concepts of business analysis as described in the BABOK® Guide. It does not include updates or changes to the content of BABOK® Guide.

The IIBA Global Business Analysis Core Standard is comprised of two main sections:
- Business Analysis Key Concepts: information that provides a foundation for understanding and applying business analysis.
- Core Standard Knowledge Areas: areas of specific business analysis expertise.

The IIBA Global Business Analysis Core Standard will help professionals who:
- Practice business analysis or want to start a career in business analysis,
- Manage business analysis professionals and require fundamental knowledge of the practice,
- Act as Business Subject Matter Experts or in any other area of practice such as Product Management, Project Management, Enterprise or Business Architecture, Quality Assurance, and Data Analytics.

# Business Analysis Key Concepts

Business Analysis Key Concepts includes information that provides a foundation for understanding and applying business analysis. The Business Analysis Key Concepts are:
- What is Business Analysis?
- Who is a Business Analyst?
- The Business Analysis Core Concept Model™
- Key Terms
- Requirements Classification Schema
- Stakeholders
- Requirements and Designs

## The Business Analysis Core Concept Model™

The Business Analysis Core Concept Model™ (BACCM™) is a conceptual framework for business analysis. It encompasses what business analysis is and what it means from a perspective, industry, methodology, or level in the organization. It is composed of six terms that have a common meaning to all business analysts and helps them discuss both business analysis and its relationships with common terminology. Each of these terms is considered to be a core concept.

The six core concepts in the BACCM are: Change, Need, Solution, Stakeholder, Value, and Context.

## Key Terms

- Business Analysis
- Business Analysis Information
- Design
- Enterprise
- Organization
- Plan
- Requirement
- Risk

## Requirements Classification Schema

For the purposes of the BABOK® Guide, the following classification schema describes requirements:
- Business requirements
- Stakeholder requirements
- Solution requirements
  - Functional requirements
  - Non-functional requirements or quality of service requirements
- Transition requirements

## Stakeholders

Each task includes a list of stakeholders who are likely to participate in the execution of that task or who will be affected by it. A stakeholder is an individual or group that a business analyst is likely to interact with directly or indirectly. The BABOK® Guide does not mandate that these roles be filled for any given initiative. Any stakeholder can be a source of requirements, assumptions, or constraints. Some examples of stakeholders include:
- Business analyst
- Customer
- Domain subject matter expert
- End user
- Implementation subject matter expert
- Operational support
- Project manager
- Regulator
- Sponsor
- Supplier
- Tester

## Requirements and Designs

Eliciting, analyzing, validating, and managing requirements have consistently been recognized as key activities of business analysis. However, it is important to recognize that business analysts are also responsible for the definition of design, at some level, in an initiative. The level of responsibility for design varies based on the perspective within which a business analyst is working.

Requirements are focused on the need; designs are focused on the solution. The distinction between requirements and designs is not always clear. The same techniques are used to elicit, model, and analyze both. A requirement leads to a design which in turn may drive the discovery and analysis of more requirements.

# Core Standard Knowledge Areas

The Core Standard knowledge areas represent areas of specific business analysis expertise that encompass several tasks. Business analysts perform tasks from all knowledge areas sequentially, iteratively, or simultaneously. Tasks may be performed in any order, as long as the necessary inputs to a task are present.
