# 2. Requirements Elicitation Techniques

Welcome to the second chapter focusing on requirements elicitation techniques!

## 2.1 Interviewing stakeholders

Interviewing stakeholders is a crucial technique used by business analysts to gather information about their needs, preferences, and expectations regarding a project or system. During interviews, business analysts ask open-ended questions to uncover requirements and clarify any ambiguities.

Key considerations for conducting stakeholder interviews include:
- Identifying relevant stakeholders and scheduling interviews accordingly
- Preparing a list of questions in advance to guide the conversation
- Actively listening to stakeholders and asking follow-up questions to delve deeper into their responses
- Documenting interview findings and ensuring that all requirements are captured accurately

## 2.2 Facilitation techniques

Facilitation techniques involve leading group discussions or workshops to elicit requirements collaboratively from stakeholders. These techniques promote active participation and engagement, helping to ensure that diverse viewpoints are considered and consensus is reached.

Common facilitation techniques include:
- Brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and solutions
- Requirements workshops to define and prioritize requirements
- Joint application development (JAD) sessions to develop prototypes and mockups
- Use of visual aids such as whiteboards and sticky notes to facilitate discussions

## 2.3 Observation and job shadowing

Observation involves directly observing stakeholders as they perform their tasks and activities within their work environment. Job shadowing takes this a step further by allowing the business analyst to shadow a stakeholder for a period of time, gaining firsthand experience of their role and responsibilities.

Observation and job shadowing provide valuable insights into:
- Stakeholder workflows and processes
- Pain points and inefficiencies in current systems
- Opportunities for improvement and innovation

## 2.4 Surveys and questionnaires

Surveys and questionnaires are tools used to collect feedback and opinions from a large number of stakeholders in a structured format. These techniques are useful for gathering quantitative data and identifying common trends or patterns among stakeholders.

Key considerations for designing effective surveys and questionnaires include:
- Clearly defining the objectives and scope of the survey
- Using clear and concise language to ensure that questions are easily understood
- Providing options for both closed-ended (e.g., multiple choice) and open-ended questions
- Analyzing survey results to identify trends and insights that can inform decision-making

## 2.5 Prototyping and wireframing

Prototyping and wireframing involve creating visual representations of a system or application to help stakeholders visualize and understand how it will look and function. Prototypes can range from low-fidelity sketches to high-fidelity interactive mockups, depending on the needs of the project.

Key benefits of prototyping and wireframing include:
- Clarifying requirements and validating design decisions early in the development process
- Gathering feedback from stakeholders to refine and improve the user experience
- Identifying potential issues or conflicts before investing time and resources in development
- Communicating design concepts and functionality to development teams and other stakeholders
